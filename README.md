# Java Reflection & Advanced Topics

This repository contains my personal study materials and experiments focused on **Java Reflection**, **Annotations**, **Proxies**, and other advanced Java concepts.

The goal of this project is to explore how Java's runtime introspection and dynamic behavior work under the hood.  
All examples are written purely for **educational and learning purposes**.
